isPrime Number

A prime is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Given integers, determine the primality of each integer and print whether it is "Prime" or "Not prime" on a new line

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, T, denoting the number of integers to check for primality. Each of the T subsequent lines contains an integer, 'N'. you must test for primality.

Constraints

1<= T <= 30

1<= n <= 2000000000000

Output Format

For each integer, print whether 'N' is "Prime" or "Not prime" on a new line.

Sample Input 0

3
12
5
7
Sample Output 0

Not prime
Prime
Prime
Explanation 0

N=12 is divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself (i.e.:2, 3, 4, 6 ), so we print Not prime on a new line

 N= 5 is only divisible 1 and itself, so we print Prime on a new line.

 N= 7 is only divisible 1 and itself, so we print Prime on a new line.
 
 Solution:
 
 #include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
 long long int a,count,i,n,j;
    scanf("%lld",&n);
   
   while(n!=0)
    {
       count=0;
        scanf("%lld",&a);
       if(a==1)
       {
         printf("Not prime\n");
       }
         else
         {
        for(j=2;j<=sqrt(a);j++)
       {
        if(a%j==0)
        {
           count=1;
            break;
        }
        }
            //printf("%d",count); 
        if(count==0)
            {
             printf("Prime\n");
                
            }
            else
            {
               printf("Not prime\n");
            }
         }
       n--;
    
    }
    return 0;
}
