Explanation 0

In Given number 123456789 the second minimum number is 2.
so we have to print 2 as output

Solution:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
long int n;
int m1=10,m2=10;
scanf("%ld",&n);
while(n)
{
int r=n%10;
if(m1>r){
m2=m1;
m1=r;
}
else if(m1<r&&r<m2)
m2=r;
n/=10;

}
if(m2==10)
printf("No\n");
else 
printf("%d\n",m2);
return 0;
}
